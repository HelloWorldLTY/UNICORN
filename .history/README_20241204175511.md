# UNICORN

This is the official code repo of paper: UNICORN: Towards Universal Cellular Expression Prediction with an Explainable Multi-Task Learning Framework. 

# Installation

To install UNICORN, please refer the content in the yml file "unicorn.yml". Idealy, it is the same as required packages from seq2cells.

If you are interested in individualized gene expression prediction, you may need to install bcftools and samtools.

```
conda install bcftools
conda install samtools
```

These instructions can help you prepare all the required files for running UNICORN.

# Model

Please check the folder **seq2cells** for details of model structure. The files under models contain the variations used in UNICORN. 

# Tutorial

We provide a tutorial for training and evaluating UNICORN in the tutorial folder. 

# Datasets

Please check this link for accessing the datasets used for training (We will update our manuscript for the full information soon):
